## Language: `Python`

# Tree Intersection  
[Click to be directed to Code Challenge](https://github.com/gracerosemary/data-structures-and-algorithms/tree/master/python/challenges/tree_intersection)       

## Challenge
rite a function called tree_intersection that takes two binary tree parameters.  
Without utilizing any of the built-in library methods available to your language, return a set of values found in both trees.

## Tests
Write at least 3 test assertions for each method defined. 

## Approach & Efficiency
time = O(n) - dependent on the number of elements 
space = O(1) - no extra space allotted
