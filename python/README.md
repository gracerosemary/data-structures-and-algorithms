## Challenge
Review given pseudocode and create a blog article with a step-through process visualized.

## Tests
- Sort given array
- Sort reverse-sorted
- Sort few uniques
- Sort nearly sorted

## Approach & Efficiency
Big O Time: O(n*2)  
- Worst case scenario, integers are sorted in reverse order, which would take the max time.
- Best case scenario, Big O would be O(1) because the array is already sorted.

Big O Space: O(1)
- Same number of pointers used, regardless of list size
