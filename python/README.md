# Data Structures and Algorithms

## Language: `Python`

# Left Join
[Click to be directed to Code Challenge](https://github.com/gracerosemary/data-structures-and-algorithms/tree/master/python/challenges/left_join)       

## Challenge
Write a function that left joins two hashmaps into a single data structure.   
Parameters: hashmap1, hashmap2  
hashmap1: word strings as keys, synonym of the key as values  
hashmap2: word strings as keys, antonyms of the key as values  

Combine the key and corresponding values (if they exist) into a new data structure according to LEFT JOIN logic.  

Left Join: all the values in the first hashmap are returned, and if values exist in the "right" hashmap, they are appended to the result row. If no values exist in the right hashmap, then NULL should be appended to the result row.

Returning data structure is up to you as long as it achieves the LEFT JOIN logic. 

## Tests
Write at least 3 test assertions for each method defined. 

## Approach & Efficiency
time = 
space =
