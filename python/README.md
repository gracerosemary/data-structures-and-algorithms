# Stacks and Queues
[Click to be directed to Code Challenge](https://github.com/gracerosemary/data-structures-and-algorithms/tree/master/python/code_challenges/stacks_and_queues)      

## Challenge
Create a Node class that has properties for the value stored in the Node, and a pointer to the next node.  
Create a Stack class that has a top property. It creates an empty Stack when instantiated.  
Create a Queue class that has a front property. It creates an empty Queue when instantiated.  

## Approach & Efficiency
Write code based on feature tasks and implement tests based on testing prompts.  

Tests:
Can successfully push onto a stack  
Can successfully push multiple values onto a stack  
Can successfully pop off the stack  
Can successfully empty a stack after multiple pops  
Can successfully peek the next item on the stack  
Can successfully instantiate an empty stack  
Calling pop or peek on empty stack raises exception  
Can successfully enqueue into a queue  
Can successfully enqueue multiple values into a queue  
Can successfully dequeue out of a queue the expected value  
Can successfully peek into a queue, seeing the expected value  
Can successfully empty a queue after multiple dequeues  
Can successfully instantiate an empty queue  
Calling dequeue or peek on empty queue raises exception
