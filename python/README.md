# Linked List Implementation
[Click to be directed to Code Challenge](https://github.com/gracerosemary/data-structures-and-algorithms/tree/linked-list/python/code_challenges/linked_list)    

## Challenge
1. Create a Node class that has properties for the value stored in the Node, and a pointer to the next Node.
2. Within your LinkedList class, include a head property. Upon instantiation, an empty Linked List should be created.
3. Define a method called insert which takes any value as an argument and adds a new node with that value to the head of the list with an O(1) Time performance.
4. Define a method called includes which takes any value as an argument and returns a boolean result depending on whether that value exists as a Nodeâ€™s value somewhere within the list.
5. Define a method called toString (or __str__ in Python) which takes in no arguments and returns a string representing all the values in the Linked List, formatted as:
"{ a } -> { b } -> { c } -> NULL"
6. Any exceptions or errors that come from your code should be semantic, capturable errors. For example, rather than a default error thrown by your language, your code should raise/throw a custom, semantic error that describes what went wrong in calling the methods you wrote for this lab.

## Approach & Efficiency
Write code based on feature tasks and implement tests based on testing prompts.
