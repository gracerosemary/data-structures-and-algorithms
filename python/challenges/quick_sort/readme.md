## Challenge
Review given pseudocode and create a blog article with a step-through process visualized.

## Tests
- Sort given array  
- Sort reverse-sorted  
- Sort few uniques  
- Sort nearly sorted  

## Approach & Efficiency
Big O Time: O(n*log(n)) || T(n) = 2 * T(n / 2) + O(n)   
Big O Space: O(n)
