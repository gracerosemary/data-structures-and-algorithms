# FIFO Animal Shelter
[Click to be directed to Code Challenge](https://github.com/gracerosemary/data-structures-and-algorithms/tree/master/python/code_challenges/fifo_animal_shelter)      

## Challenge
Create a class called AnimalShelter which holds only dogs and cats. Use FIFO approach.

## Approach & Efficiency
`enqueue(value)`: add animal to the shelter (only dog or cat object)  
`dequeue()`: returns either a dog or cat. If `pref` is not dog or cat, should return Null.
