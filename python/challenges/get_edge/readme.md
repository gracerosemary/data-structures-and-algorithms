# Graph - Get Edge
[Click to be directed to Code Challenge](https://github.com/gracerosemary/data-structures-and-algorithms/tree/master/python/challenges/get_edge)       

## Challenge
`AddNode()`: Adds a new node to the graph. Takes in the value of that node. Returns the added node.  
`AddEdge()`: Adds a new edge between two nodes in the graph. Include the ability to have a “weight”. Takes in the two nodes to be connected by the edge. Both nodes should already be in the Graph.  
`GetNodes()`: Returns all of the nodes in the graph as a collection (set, list, or similar)  
`GetNeighbors()`: Returns a collection of edges connected to the given node. Takes in a given node. Include the weight of the connection in the returned collection.  
`Size()`: Returns the total number of nodes in the graph.  
`breadth_first()`: Accepts a starting node and returns a collection of nodes in the order they were visited. 
`get_edge()`: Takes in a graph and an array of city names. Return whether the full trip is possible with direct flights, and how much it would cost.  
 
## Tests
- False output
- True output with 1 edge
- True output with more than one 1 edge

## Approach & Efficiency
time = O(n)   
space = O(1)
